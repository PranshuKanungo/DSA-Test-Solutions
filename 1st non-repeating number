CODE: 
TC = O(N) SC: O(1)
Algorithm :
1. first store the frequency of the letters in the hashmap using get() function.
2. After storing, traverse the hashmap and check for the value i.e frequency==1.
3. The very first key it will encounter whose value is equal to 1 will be returned.

s = "leetcode"
def firstdifferentnumber():
    n = len(s)

    hashmap = {}
    for i in range(n):
        c = s[i]
        hashmap[c] = hashmap.get(c,0)+1
    for i in range(n):
        if hashmap[s[i]] ==1:
            return i
        return -1
print(firstdifferentnumber())
Output : 0
